# Launching a Research study

## Questions
* How do you divvy up the work with the professor. (Raj paid $2500 for the MD professor)
* How do you find a professor 

## Examples: 
1) https://99u.adobe.com/articles/7274/how-i-gave-up-email-and-reclaimed-3-hours-a-day
    * the 99u content team chose to have it written in a first person voice to build trust with readers. i pushed back really hard on this at the time but in retrospect it worked really well. it’s personal. it’s vulnerable and so it draws people in. they also stripped out a lot of the data we shared again to emphasise the personal pain caused by bad working habits. i again pushed back and argued it would help with credibility but they said no. again, a very wise choice.
