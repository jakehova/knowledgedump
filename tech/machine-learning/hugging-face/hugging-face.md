## General Information 
* Mission - Democratize Good Machine Learning
* Building a model consists of collecting data, organizing it, labeling it and refining it.  
* **Transfer Learning** - Using pre-built models to carry out tasks in machine learning
  * Identify the **task** matching your problem:
    * Text: sentiment analaysis, summarization
    * Images: classification, object detection
    * Speech: speech to text, speaker separation
  * Pick a **pre-trained** state-of-the-art-model 
  * Fine tune the pre-trained model that was chosen
