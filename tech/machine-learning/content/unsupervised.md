| Algorithm | Example | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clustering | Google News | scrape news sites and find articles with the same grouping of words and classify them as the same type of news story  |


## Algorithm
* Clustering 
  * Takes data without labels and attempts to group seemingly related items together
* Anomoly Detection
  * Find unusual data points
* Dimensionality reduction
  * Compress data using fewer numbers
