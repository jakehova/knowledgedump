## Perplexity
* quantifies how well a language model predicts a given sequence of words
  * easier read: perplexity represents the avg number of choices a language model has for predicting the next word
* lower the score, better the model
* `Perplexity = 2^(-Î£(log2(p(w)))`
  * p(w) is the probability assigned by the language model to each word in the test set.

## Burstiness
