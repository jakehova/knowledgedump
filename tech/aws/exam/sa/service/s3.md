    * Write once, read many
    * spiky data access
    * Large number of users and diverse amounts of content
    * growing data sets
    * **QUESTION** Use elastic for block storage  - what is elastic?  what is block storage?
* Costs
    * GBs/mo
    * transfer out to other regions or teh internet
    * put, copy, post, list, and get requests
    * DONT have to pay for data going in or transfer out to EC2 in same region or transfer out to Cloudfront
* Naming Format: 
    * https://<bucket name>.s3.amazonaws.com
    * https://<bucket name>.s3.amazonaws.com/<filename>
* Bucket Policy (bucket policy is just IAM rules)
    * written in JSON documents
* Features
    * Access Points
    * Simplifies access management for shared large datasets
    * Hosting static websites
    * Access Control - CORS
        * Generate CORS Configuration file and apply it to a bucket
    * Multipart Upload
        * take one file, split it into multiple parts and upload each part in parallel
* TRANSER OPTIONS: 
    * Transfer Acceleration
        * Upload to an edge location.  Edge location uploads to s3 bucket.
    * Snowball
        * petabyte storage transfer
    * Snowmobile
        * exabyte storage transfer
* TYPES: 
    * Glacier - long term data storage, archival or backup, very low cost storage
        * OPtions for storage 
            * Archives - created automatically when uploading to Glacier
                - gets an id that is unique across the region 
            * Vaults 
                - can store multiple archives 
        * Options for retrieval 
            * Expedited retrievla  - 5 minutes
            * Standard - 3 hours
            * bulk - 5 hours
        * Deep Archive - rarely accessed.  used primarily for compliancy storage (keep for years)
    * IA - long lived, infrequently access - store for backup data 
    * IA One Zone - long lived, infrequent but rapid access - good choice for secondary backup data 
        * Instead of using it in 3 AZs as normal, it stores it in one AZ
    * Intelligent Tiering - automatically moves objects between two access tiers of storage
* Lifecycle policies - allow you to delete or move objects based on age 
    * ex: after 30 days move to IA, after 60 days move to glacier, after 365 days delete/move to deep archives
