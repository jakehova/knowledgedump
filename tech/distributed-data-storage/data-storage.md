# Data Storage

- [[ipfs]] IPFS
- [[hyper-core]] HyperCore

# IPFS
- highly generic
- content hash data is primary primitive (probably SHA512 to create id of asset)
- Merkel DAG - giant data structure (DAG directed acyclic graph)
  - When someone wants access to the IPFS asset, it creates a pointer to that static asset 
  - When data is dynamic, then they create a public key that points to the asset

# HyperCore (used to be DAT)
- more defined
- always working with a log of data
- logs (Merkel Tree turned on its side) have a public key as the address (similar to GIT)
- when youre building
