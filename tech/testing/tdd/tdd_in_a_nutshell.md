# TDD in a Nutshell

Goal of this doc is to give an overview of the basic concepts surrounding TDD

## Basics Pattern
* write test and code in same window when first starting out
* write test to fail initially to ensure that test can/will fail
* write code to make test pass 
* for any exception testing, write specific expections that will handle details of error being caught
* refactor code/tests as you go
