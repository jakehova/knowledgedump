# Tensorflow


## Common Terms
* Deep Learning results feed better Machine Learning Models.  Better Machine Learning Models feed better AI.
* AI - Science of making things smart
    * Narrow AI - A system that can do one or a few things well or better than a human
* Machine Learning - An approach to achieve AI by finding patterns in a set of data
    * Examples: 
        * Computer Vision: 
            * Object vs Image Recognition
                * Object Recognition - detects how many and where objects are in an image
                * Image Recognition - detects what is in the image but does not tell you where or how many there are
        * Numerical Prediction 
            * Regression: Predicting a numerical value from other numerical inputs (i.e. predicting house prices based on sq footage)
        * Natural Language 
            * Semantic Analysis and Content Summary analaysis of naturally spoken Language
        * Audio 
            * Speech recognition - Translate audio to text
        * Generative
            * Style Transfer/Creative - Generating realistic images of human faces or transofmring human faces or transforming human voices into musical instruments.
* Deep Learning - A technique for implementing machine Learning.  Involves **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)** code strcutures that are arranged in layers.  Each layer filters a pattern out of other patterns and continues to filter the pattern until an output is given.
