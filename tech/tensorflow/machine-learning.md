# Machine Learning

## What is it 
* Numbers In -> Numbers Out.  Computers only understand numbers so all inputs have to be numbers.  So both input and output of a model will be numerical.   
* All models are initially **untrained**

## Types
* Supervised Learning - Train by labeled examples
    * You provide data and label them in categories (i.e. you provide weight & color attributes for fruit and then you label the fruit with it's name.)
    * Only works well if you provide diverse and well-labeled data.  
* Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabled data.  Leverages clustering to group items that closely share similar measured attributes.
* Reinforcement Learning - Set a reward function and let ML program figure out the best way to solve.
