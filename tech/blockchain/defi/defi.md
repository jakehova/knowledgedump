## Picking an Arbitrage strategy
* **Note** 
    * Most of these discrepancies are something like 0.05%, so really small.  So you can make real money when you buy/sell a LOT (i.e. flash loan).
    * Stablecoins usually have the most liquidity
    * Need something that is on decentralized exchanges (DEX)  
* Simple Arbitrage
    * Use One Token Leverage price discrepancy across network buy on one exchange sell on another
    * Prioritize assets that have high liquidity
        * Assets with low liquidity have high slippage rates so they are tougher to trade
* Triangle Arbitrage
    * Use 3 Tokens (Token A can be exchanged for Token B.  Token B can be exchanged for Token C.  Token A can be exchanged for Token C)
    * When you see an opportunity where theres a difference between exchanging Token A for C directly compared to A to B to C    
* Mean reversion
    * Use Stablecoins
    * Calculate the mean value of the coin ($1 for one USDC).  When the price of USDC drops below that $1, you buy it.  Then you just wait until the price goes back up to $1. 
    * **Does not work with flash loan**

## Pick an Asset
* DAI and USDC are stable coins with high liquidity that are on DEXes
* DAI is more volatile than USDC

## Pick DEXes
* Requirements 
    * Must trade the Asset 
    * Must have a lot Asset liquidity
    * Can use [Defi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/) to find main DEXes
    * Must have good developer exchange
* Kyber and Uniswap fit all this criteria
