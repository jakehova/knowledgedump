## Setting up Testing



## Non-Local Test Networks
* Ropsten: The official test network, created by The Ethereum Foundation. Its functionality is similar to the MainNet.
* Kovan: A network that uses a consensus method called "proof-of-authority". This means its transactions are validated by select members, leading to a consistent four second block time. The supply of ether on this testnet is also controlled to mitigate spam attacks.
* Rinkeby: A testnet also using proof-of-authority, created by The Ethereum Foundation.
