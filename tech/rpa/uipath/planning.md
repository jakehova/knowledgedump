# Solution planning

Calculation for good candidates for RPA: 
* Process Fitness: 
1) Is it Rule Based
2) Is it repetitive
3) Is there standard input
4) Is it stable
* Automation Complexity
1) Number of screens
2) types of applications
3) how many decision points are there
4) Types/Numbers of input


Process for automating: 
1) Prepare RPA - Define the processes, assessed, prioritized, and implementation is planned
2) Solution Design - 
* Each process to be automated is documented "as is" and "to be" 
* Test scenarios are created 
* Environments are created
3) Build RPA - build/test/verified
4) Test RPA - UAT and process is signed off on
5) Stabilize RPA - Go-Live is prepared and the process is moved to prod, monitored, and measured
6) Take lessons learned and improve existing processes
