## Connecting Power Pages to Dataverse
* Power Pages connect to Dataverse using Server to Server (S2S) connection. 
  * The connection is established via an Microsoft Entra application that is created when a Power Page is created. 
    * The naming convention for the Entra Application is `(Portals â€“ {{portalid}})`
    * The id for the Entra Application can be found in the [workspace setup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-pages/configure/setup-workspace) for that Power Page
    *  **DO NOT MODIFY THE ENTRA APPLICATION**
*  The connection uses the Dataverse **SYSTEM** or **APPLICATION** user.  [More Info](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/system-application-users).  Current sites use [Application user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/manage-application-users).
   *  Can view Application User in Power Platfrom Admin Center -> selecting the environment -> and go to Acces -> Select S2S apps
      *  Application User format: `# Portals-<<site name>>`

*  When a Power Page is created: 
   *  The Entra Application is created
   *  Application Users are created
   *  An X509 certificate is generated and added to the Entra Application and App Server hosting the Power Page.    
      *  This cert allows access from application server to Dataverse
      *  **THE CERT EXPIRES EVERY TWO YEARS AND SHOULD BE [UPDATED](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-pages/admin/manage-auth-key)**
